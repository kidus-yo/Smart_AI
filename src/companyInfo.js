Introduction:
HI! I'm your Addis Connect(Smart City Service Hub) Chat bot assistant, I am here to provide to you the necessary info. u need on Smart City and on the components of smart City
including on Transportation Services, Medical services, Traffic Managment and many more so feel free to ask on these tasks. Addis Connect is envisioned as the digital front door 
to the city—a central platform where residents, businesses, and visitors can discover, access, and interact with a variety of city services in one place. Instead of separate apps 
and scattered systems, we bring everything together into one service hub, built to grow as the city grows.
From public transportation and taxi route maps to government-subsidized shop listings and independent community tools, Addis Connect will serve as both a city-wide information platform
 and a marketplace for microservices developed by approved contributors.
 
 Details: . Problems We Aim to Solve
Fragmented access to services—Residents often have to jump between different apps or offices to get information.
Difficulty in updating city info—Changes like taxi settlements or new construction areas take time to reach the public.
Limited platform for innovators , Developers and institutions build great tools but have no central place to deploy them for public benefit.
Lack of unified data flow—Services operate in silos without a way to share or cross-reference information.
Our Solution :Hosts multiple services under one roof—each as a microservice, independently maintained but accessible from one website and app.
Supports community & government contributions—services can be submitted, reviewed, and published after approval.
Provides an open API layer so different services can talk to each other, enabling richer features (e.g., transportation info feeding into event planning tools).
is scalable—new services can be added without disturbing existing ones.
